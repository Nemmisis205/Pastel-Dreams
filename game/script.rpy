    aj "Oh, right. Let me go grab the sack I brought with me. One moment Pinkie!"
    "Applejack goes to a corner of the room and returns with a sack of what I assume to be apples inside."
    p "Great! Just dump them into the big bucket over there!"
    p "The other game tonight will be... pin the tail on the pony!"
    "The crowd cheers."
    "Must be a favourite."
    p "And our first contestant will be... " 
    "Pinkie waves her hoof around the crowd."
    "And around..."
    "And around..."
    "She's making weird sounds."
    "She finally lets her hoof fall towards...{w} me."
    a "Me?!"
    p "Uh-huh! This party is for you and I doubt you've ever played pin the tail on the pony so I want to see you how you'll go at it!"
    "Eh, fuck it. I'll take it in stride."
    "I puff out my chest, and put my hands on my hips."
    a "I may have never played pin the tail on the pony but I never turn down a good challenge!"
    "The crowd erupts again, pleased with my gusto."
    "This is going to be a great night indeed."
